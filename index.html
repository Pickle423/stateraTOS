    <h1>Statera Discord Bot</h1>
    <em><h2>Made by an idiot with a dream</h2></em>

    <p>TOS: 
      \nTERMS OF SERVICE AGREEMENT
\n\n
This Terms of Service Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into between Pickle423 ("Bot Owner") and the user ("User") of the Statera Discord bot (the "Bot").
\n\n
By using the Bot, the User agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If the User does not agree to the terms of this Agreement, they should immediately discontinue use of the Bot.
\n\n
The user agrees to not sue or otherwise hold the Bot Owner (me) responsible for any damages or costs. The Bot Owner can modify the bot's service or end service at any point.
\n\n
      Privacy Policy:
      \n\n
      Per the discord:
      \n\n
      Statera does not read messages except commands, but other bots do.

Statera receives activity update events, such as when a member of your server joins/leaves a VC. This is for the autoVoiceChannel function. Statera will still receive these events if that function is not enabled on your server, however it will disregard them.
\n\n
What will we do with data you put into Statera? Probably nothing, except obviously Statera will use it as needed. For right now, I’ll probably check some random jsons (file format used to store data) every so often to get an idea of what the bot is being used for. Users are saved with ID's, so we can't see any server nicknames or things of that variety. Though if we really wanted we could use the ID to see your profile.
\n\n
Please do not put any personal information into a welcome message, or roster, or any other command Statera has. I don’t want to have home addresses or SSN’s on the server. Your data is not encrypted, and is hardly even protected.
\n\n
Be aware that this should generally apply to all bots. Giving bots administrator privileges is dangerous too. There have been at least two big bots recently that had major vulnerabilities. Double Counter and CaptchaBot to name them. These vulnerabilities originated from their developers' incompetence putting authentication code into client-side javascript. Discord Bot Developers are not professionals, do not trust them to do things right. 
\n\n
To this end, while I trust myself, and Statera lacks a web interface like how these bots were compromised. Not all functions of Statera need admin. If you intend to use Statera for just music or welcome messages, do not give Statera admin. If you give Statera admin, keep the role giving Statera admin below any roles with special priviliges. This would prevent Statera from assigning roles in the event it was compromised. Please be safe with random discord applications.
